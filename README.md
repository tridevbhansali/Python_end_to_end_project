# Web Scraping and EDA in Python using Selenium, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

In this jupyter notebook I documented web scraping and exploratory data analysis using Python .


## The process is as follows:

1.Use Python's Selenium library to scrape a webpage

2.load the scraped data into a pandas dataframe

3.Do some basic exploratory data anlaysis on the dataframe

4.Basic visualization

#### For this article's purpose I scraped Men's T-shirt data from https://www.myntra.com/men-tshirts website.

## What is the need of Selenium?

Some websites don't like to be scrapped and in that case you need to disguise your webscraping bot as a Human Being.
